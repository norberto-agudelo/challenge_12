# challenge_12 Plotly & Belly Button Biodiversity
## Overview 

Roza is a biological researcher who works for an important microbiology laboratory. She is interested in finding bacteria species that jave the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. She thinks that those bacterias can be found inhuman beings belly buttons.

To prove that theory, Roza has sampled the navel of some volunteer people across the country to identify bacterial species that live in their belly buttons. She needs to build  an interactive dashboard that volunteers and researchers can  access.

To do that, she is going to use Plotly, a Java Script data visualization library, as well other tools to create the required dashboard where volunteers can identify the top 10 bacterial species that live in their belly buttons. 

So, beside the dashboard building, the main purpose of this project is to investigate the sample data available in order to identify the top ten bacterial species in each belly button bacteria sample as well to  identify a potential bacteria candidate that could synthetize beef taste.
